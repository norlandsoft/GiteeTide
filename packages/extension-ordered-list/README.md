## Introduction

This extension enables you to use ordered lists (similar to the HTML tag `<ol>`) in the editor.

## Features

This extension modifies the following features based on `@tiptap/extension-ordered-list`:

- Input rule: Quickly creates an ordered list by typing `1. `, `1) `, or `1ï¼‰ ` (can be any number) at the beginning of a line
- If there is an ordered list before or after creating an ordered list item, it will automatically merge into one ordered list
- In a bullet list or task list, you can quickly convert it to an ordered list by typing content that meets the above input rules at the beginning of a list item.
