## Build and Run

Tide uses [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) to manage the compilation and distribution of multiple npm packages and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) to manage local dependencies.

```shell
git clone https://gitee.com/oschina/tide.git

cd tide

# Install dependencies
pnpm i

# Build packages
pnpm build

# Run the demo for development, it will automatically open the browser
pnpm dev:demo --open
```

> Due to the complex dependency relationships in the monorepo, local builds are not currently supported for use through `npm link`, `yarn link`, and `pnpm link --global`.
